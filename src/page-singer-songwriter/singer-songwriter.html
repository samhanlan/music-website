                                        What a waste of skin<br/>
                                        the man you let in<br/>
                                        and what a price to have paid<br/>
                                        to have it your way<br/>
                                        I'm amazed you stayed<br/>
                                        I mean, what an ugly place<br/>
                                        Not strong enough to call his bluff<br/>
                                        or leave the love to rust.<br/><br/>
                                        I will always have my sympathies for you<br/>
                                        let's loosen up the bandages, inspect the wounds<br/>
                                        I'll show you mine, you show me yours, we've nothing to prove<br/>
                                        we're just a pair of hypercondiacs in bloom.<br/><br/>
                                        You: trained to stay
                                        a little faith couldn't save you<br/>
                                        no better off getting lost<br/>
                                        with the one who couldn't hope to stay afloat.<br/><br/>
                                        Turned up one day, took it all away<br/>
                                        what a waste of space<br/>
                                        he's all guts and no brains, but the heart breaks all the same<br/>
                                        and <i>no one escapes</i><br/>
                                        trying desperately to come clean<br/>
                                        fuck sake, just say what you mean<br/>
                                        or do me the decency<br/>
                                        and leave me be.<br/>

                                        no better off getting lost<br/>
                                        with the one who couldn't hope to stay afloat.<br/><br/>
                                        Let me help you man, 'cus I have been there<br/>
                                        and I can tell you that it don't go anywhere<br/>
                                        you've got to stack your needs<br/>

                                        and I'm going back for more<br/>
                                        and more<br/>
                                        and more.<br/>

                                        I'd like to behave<br/>
                                        but you're calling my name<br/>
                                        it's just another time<br/>
                                        and I'm just another time<br/>
                                        and I wouldn't be ready for you<br/>
                                        if you were mine.<br/><br/>
                                        It's <i>coming easy</i><br/>
                                        but it's leaving easier<br/>
                                        and it's <i>coming easy</i><br/>
                                        but it's leaving easier.<br/><br/>
                                        I'll let you slip ahead<br/>
                                        from me and my peg-leg<br/>
                                        reserved for the curb<br/>
                                        in the middle of the road<br/>
                                        I'd say a vow<br/>
                                        but it's such an empty sound<br/>
                                        I'd rather lay down<br/>
                                        kiss your mouth.<br/><br/>
                                        There is nothing in my heart<br/>
                                        that I wouldn't take apart for you<br/>
                                        just take a look here<br/>
                                        there is plenty of room.</br/>
                                        So I'll dust off my receiver<br/>
                                        and you'll open up your signal<br/>
                                        and I'll finally hear you rising<br/>
                                        from the crackle of the speaker<br/>
                                        the warmth of your sweet voice<br/>
                                        lights a fire in my eardrums<br/>
                                        and the coming, endless going<br/>
                                        isn't easy, and you know it<br/>
                                        so come on, honey, don't you make me<br/>
                                        go it alone<br/>
                                        don't make me.<br/>

                                        given you the slip<br/>
                                        crossed you off of the list<br/>

                                        and if I'd only found higher ground<br/>
                                        I might have survived<br/>
                                        So just come with me, quietly<br/>
                                        I know a place I can put you to use.<br/><br/>
                                        This will be your tomb: my engine room<br/>
                                        so knuckle down<br/>
                                        it looks like <i>you work for me now</i><br/>
                                        welcome to the house of fun<br/>
                                        where I get all my thinking done<br/>
                                        twenty-four years, finally in the clear<br/>
                                        still living in the wake<br/>
                                        of all my mistakes.<br/><br/>
                                        But I am not a slave driver<br/>
                                        I've got time for ya<br/>
                                        and I will keep you close<br/>
                                        you'll never even know I'm there.<br/><br/>
                                        Lay down in the snow<br/>
                                        a deep freeze<br/>
                                        could really cool me down<br/>
                                        so turn off the taps and relax<br/>
                                        I just like having you around<br/>
                                        we can reconcile<br/>
                                        with a knowing smile<br/>
                                        some piece of mind<br/>
                                        or rattle through the days<br/>
                                        loosen the chains<br/>
                                        and live like free men.<br/>
                                        But until then...<br/><br/>
                                        This will be your tomb: my engine room<br/>
                                        so join the crowd<br/>
                                        it looks like <i>you work for me now</i><br/>
                                        or am I doing it wrong<br/>
                                        did I come on too strong<br/>
                                        like a drunk on a crawl<br/>
                                        too heavy, as always<br/>
                                        they handed down the days<br/>
                                        just camping in my grave<br/>
                                        where I will remain<br/>
                                        with all my mistakes.<br/>
                                        <span class="elipses">...</span><br/>
                                        Bleeding like a pig<br/>
                                        over everything that you ever loved<br/>
                                        so hold the creature down<br/>
                                        and we'll cut it's throat<br/>
                                        you can be my guest<br/>
                                        believe me, this what I want<br/>
                                        let's just get it done<br/>
                                        breathe a sigh of relief<br/>
                                        as we put it to rest.<br/>

                                        Man is cheap to run<br/>
                                        not easily undone<br/>
                                        his furnace burns a duller sun<br/>
                                        until his love is done<br/>
                                        the head obeys the body<br/>
                                        body's life is lonely<br/>
                                        lovers never knowing<br/>
                                        the fire's heat is weak<br/>
                                        the precious dead and long gone<br/>
                                        sat beside them so long<br/>
                                        spat them out a swan song<br/>
                                        but left the lights all on<br/>
                                        so cheap and badly framed<br/>
                                        the weening and the waned<br/>
                                        hang thin across these days<br/>
                                        and he can't be loved again.<br/><br/>
                                        But I can<br/>
                                        and I will<br/>
                                        in our bed<br/>
                                        that's where we'll live<br/>
                                        the master of my callow heart<br/>
                                        the dye is cast, now<br/>
                                        so where to start<br/>
                                        and sure enough<br/>
                                        easy to love.<br/><br/>
                                        Where exactly is the line<br/>
                                        that I drew the last time<br/>
                                        hands have never been so<br/>
                                        dirty by design<br/>
                                        heaven opened up its gates<br/>
                                        but I went round the back way<br/>
                                        had myself a long stay<br/>
                                        and left the way I came<br/>
                                        dig a little hole, where<br/>
                                        the man can call his home, where<br/>
                                        silence fills the air, where<br/>
                                        the devil makes his lair.<br/>
                                        Or live a little larger<br/>
                                        we can farm a little harder<br/>
                                        we can walk a little farther<br/>
                                        and love a little, too.<br/><br/>
                                        We're sailing hard along the causeway<br/>
                                        strapped with nothing more to say<br/>
                                        they'll pick apart any words you'll find<br/>
                                        and you can't have mine<br/>
                                        so are you ready to die<br/>
                                        pinch yourself and feel alive<br/>
                                        sail away to the other place<br/>
                                        with the <i>pretty lawns and pearly gates.</i><br/>
                                        Send a letter when you arrive<br/>
                                        let me know that you'll be alright<br/>
                                        in the vault, you can look inside<br/>
                                        it'll probably be time.<br/><br/>
                                        But I can<br/>
                                        and I will<br/>
                                        in our bed<br/>
                                        that's where we'll live<br/>
                                        the bodies piled up in my mind<br/>
                                        the dye is cast, now<br/>
                                        so where to start<br/>
                                        and sure enough<br/>

                        <p>British Berlin-based singer-songwriter.</p> 
                        <p>Since early years spent in the small-town basement studio writing and performing with my first band, 
                            that frenetic energy has given way to a softer-edged acoustic direction.</p>
                        <p>After moving to Berlin in 2015, the combination of time and good company has helped me explore my solo material further than I expected. 
                            Now here I am about to release my debut EP Sharp Relief, a record I'm proud to finally share.</p>
