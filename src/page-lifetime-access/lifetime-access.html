      <p>
        What a time to be alive<br />
        Without a cause, you’re out the door<br />
        Say “hello, world”, what are you for?<br />
        What are we moving towards?<br />
        You’ve painted us in to a corner<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Pull me from my nest<br />
        Throw me under your wheels<br />
        Capsized and desperate<br />
        Restless, unheeding<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        String me line, toss me a dime<br />
        I tried being helpless<br />
        But nothing much comes of it<br />
        Wind me back up, before I run out the clock<br />
        With my head on the block<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Shake me from my tree<br />
        Put me to work in your fields<br />
        Morning and evening<br />
        Hold me, feed me
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the captain and the crew<br />
        Are abandoning you<br />
        Do you know how to turn this vessel alone?<br />
        Can you read your map from the stars?<br />
        Can you navigate back to the harbour?<br />
        Or stick like a pig on the iceberg<br />
        Or snag on the rocks like the anchor.

      <p>
        Haven’t I given enough?<br />
        What about all that good shit I done?<br />
        Didn’t it do it for anyone?<br />
        Heading on down to the brink<br />
        We’re all thinking about stepping in<br />
        Or taking up residence
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a complicated act of god<br />
        It just felt wrong<br />
        Like a stern word in the birdsong<br />
        It just didn’t belong
      </p>

      <p>
        Like an answer and a lie, perfectly combined<br />
        But never aligned<br />
        A roaring symphony of broken rhyme and harmony<br />
        That's so me
      </p>
      <p>
        How about mellowing out?<br />
        Pushing it all the way down<br />
        Letting your hair out the tower<br />
        I can see you’re completely connected to your grief<br />
        No sharp relief
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a complicated act of god<br />
        It just felt wrong<br />
        Like a stern word in the birdsong<br />
        I just didn’t belong
      </p>
      <p>
        Like an answer and a lie, perfectly combined<br />
        But never aligned<br />
        A roaring symphony of broken rhyme and harmony<br />
        That's soo mee
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah you can complain<br />
        I’ll be sure to pass it along<br />
        Should have know you could do no wrong<br />
        So many words, nothing to say<br />
        I get you people every day<br />
        You’re just more hair in the clay
      </p>
      <p>The second you shut your mouth I’d already blacked out</p>
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics" id="lyrics-LA">
      <p>
        You say it was a game<br />
        But I almost had you<br />
        How did I do, what can you prove<br />
        Full disclosure<br />
        Brainless no-name<br />
        There’s no fooling me again<br />
        Up on my hill, all you can build<br />
        Is my landfill<br />
        Animated statue with an animal's statute<br />
        There is no more meat on my bones<br />
        For you to chew<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Pieces are missing, others are listening in<br />
        But they’ll learn nothing new, til I have you<br />
        Such is the sweet ether that collides in the night<br />
        With the sweat and the cold gripping your soul
      </p>
      <p>
        Your stolen plates<br />
        Even the children can place<br />
        you at the scene, and how will you plead?<br />
        Easily: guilty<br />
        I was just doing my job, the bait on the line<br />
        Well, are you blind? Was it a crime?<br />
        Honest kindness
      </p>
      <p>
        Picking through the rubble, like picking a wound<br />
        Like coffee in our kitchen without you<br />
        Spin me another web, can we keep on dancing<br />
        Til I forget my lines, or you fumble the script
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of us looking for lifetime access<br />
        A full-time mutual subscription<br />
        A ladder to prop up at my window<br />
        A piece of my heart for a seat at your table
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics" id="lyrics-TW">
      <p>
        Finally, some time with The Wizard<br />
        Some company in these woods<br />
        An excuse to complain, is it?<br />
        Or an exercise in restraint
      </p>
      <p>
        I said: I am tired of nature,<br />
        I grow weary with peace<br />
        Is there a spell that you can cast<br />
        That can break what was meant to last
      </p>

      <p>
        He said: I know very well that you understand<br />
        That a grand don’t come for free
      </p>

      <p>
        How about some potion, then?<br />
        Or a powerful emotion<br />
        Some wise words, softly spoken<br />
        Some savvy incantation
      </p>
      <p>
        Or I’ll take your staff<br />
        And break your will<br />
        And have your head<br />
        And be done with it
      </p>

      <p>
        I can take my own compliments<br />
        I can make my own medicine<br />
        I can build a tower and a fence<br />
        Around my shallow sentiments
      </p>

      <p>
        He said: I know very well that you can survive<br />
        But a grand don’t grow on trees
      </p>
      <p>
        Foul words are spoken and the exchange is made<br />
        And he leaves me<br />
        Groaning under silence<br />
        Now I am the boundary<br />
        Now I am the contract<br />
        I am the combination<br />
        <strong>AND I AM TO BE OBEYED</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the empty hallway<br />
        I am the waiting memory<br />
        And with armies bowed before me<br />
        And you, you are my queen<br />
        And I am curled and tiny<br />
        At your feet
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics" id="lyrics-UTB">
      <p>
        I didn’t give an inch<br />
        And I sure am glad to say<br />
        That there’s still pressure in the pipes<br />
        And still life behind the eyes
      </p>
      <p>
        Left ears twisting in the wind<br />
        And lips frozen closed again<br />
        Well, if you can punch it in<br />
        Why don’t you use your words, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll all huddle<br />
        Under the banner<br />
        Together, for better or worse
      </p>
      <p>
        They said: only date winners<br />
        But I’m really doing me right now<br />
        Then like a true beginner,<br />
        tumbling back down to the ground
      </p>
      <p>
        They said: I can offer you nothing<br />
        But it’ll cost you something<br />
        Well I’d take that deal<br />
        When we are so poorly placed to seize the day
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll all huddle<br />
        Under the banner<br />
        Together, and weather the storm
      </p>
